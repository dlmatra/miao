ATOMIC DATA FILES FROM THE CHIANTI DATABASE
-------------------------------------------

The CHIANTI database is a database for atomic data for typical ions in
astrophysics. The web site is:

   http://www.chiantidatabase.org/

We use, from this database, the energy levels, the radiative transition
rates and the collisional transition rates, i.e. all that we need to 
do LTE and non-LTE line transfer in these lines.

RADMC-3D needs these atomic data in the format of the LAMDA database (see
../leiden/ directory for more information). So we need to convert from
CHIANTI into LAMDA format. To this end there are a set of IDL subroutines 
in this directory. To get going, do the following:

 - Download and install the CHIANTI database package, following the 
   instructions on their web site. 

 - Edit the "chianti_startup.pro" file located here to set the paths
   right, so that IDL can find the CHIANTI package. 

 - Go into IDL

 - Type:  @chianti_startup

 - Type:  .r convert_chianti_to_leiden_session.pro
   (never mind the NaN warnings)

 - This should now create the file called molecule_o+2.inp, which is
   the LAMDA-style atomic data file for doubly ionized oxygen (i.e.
   O++ or OIII). It only gives the first 6 levels and the corresponding
   transitions. Edit convert_chianti_to_leiden_session.pro to output
   more levels, or to choose another atom/ion.
