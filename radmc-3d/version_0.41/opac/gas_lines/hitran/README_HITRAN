MOLECULAR DATA FILES FROM THE HITRAN DATABASE
---------------------------------------------

The HITRAN database contains molecular data for rotational and
ro-vibrational transitions of a set of common molecules in the Earth's
atmosphere. The web site is:

   http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/hitran/

Since LTE is usually a good assumption in planetary atmospheres, these
datafiles contain "only" line lists. These data is therefore not suitable
for non-LTE radiative transfer.

The subroutines in this directory convert the HITRAN style line lists
into RADMC-3D style line lists. RADMC-3D style line lists have the lines
of different molecules and their isotopologues separated: One list per
isotopologue/molecule. This allows the user to specify exactly the 
abundance of each isotopologue or molecule separately. 

To produce RADMC-3D style line lists from the HITRAN database, do the
following:

 - Request access to HITRAN (see web site) by emailing to L. Rothman

 - Ftp to their web site and download the by-molecule files called:
       01_hit08.par         
       02_hit08_f53.par     
       03_hit08.par         
       04_hit08.par         
       05_hit08.par         
       06_hit08.par         
       07_hit08.par         
       08_hit08.par         
       09_hit08.par         
       10_hit08.par         
       11_hit08.par         
       12_hit08.par         
       13_hit08.par         
       14_hit08.par         
       15_hit08.par
   as well as the following additional files:
       molparam.txt
       parsum.dat

 - Go into IDL

 - Type .r convert_hitran_to_radmc3d_linelist_session.pro

 - This should produce line lists for a set of molecules. This is not
   the full list! Please add further lines to the file
   convert_hitran_to_radmc3d_linelist_session.pro to add further 
   molecules (each of the above **_hit08* files is one molecule with
   several possible isotopologues). Since the partition sum table
   (required for LTE transfer) is in the parsum.dat file, you will
   have to figure out which column of parsum.dat belongs to which
   molecule/isotopologue. That is why getting more molecules is a 
   bit of hand-work. But the examples in the file
   convert_hitran_to_radmc3d_linelist_session.pro will help you 
   figure out how this works. See also the ByMolecule-Readme.pdf 
   file from the ftp site of HITRAN to help you find your molecule
   of interest.

 - The plot_linelist.pro program helps you visualize the lines by
   plotting the opacity or emissivity of the lines for a given 
   temperature (again: assuming LTE).
