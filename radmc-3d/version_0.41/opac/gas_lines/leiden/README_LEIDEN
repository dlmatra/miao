MOLECULAR DATA FILES FROM THE LEIDEN LAMDA DATABASE
---------------------------------------------------

The Leiden molecular database contains data for (mostly) rotational
transitions of molecules of astrophysical interest. The files from the
Leiden "LAMDA" database can be directly fed into RADMC-3D. No conversion is
required. This database contains the required data for LTE and non-LTE line
transfer in molecular lines. The database is specialized on rotational
(i.e. sub-millimeter) lines. But the format is valid for lines of any
kind. The database can be found at:

   http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~moldata/

Note that this also features the RADEX code which is very handy for 
getting a first feeling for the behavior of these molecular lines as
a function of density and temperature.

NOTE: To use these files in RADMC-3D, you must rename them. Example:
      The co.dat file must be renamed to molecule_co.inp
