For doing LTE and non-LTE line transfer RADMC-3D needs to know the energy
level structure of the atom or molecule, the radiative transitions and their
rates, and (for non-LTE transfer) the collision transition rates. RADMC-3D
does not care about whether it is an atom or a molecule, whether it is a
rotational, vibrational or electronic transition etc. It only needs to know
the above data and it will be able to do its work. 

As of version 0.28, RADMC-3D can read two types of atomic/molecular data
files:

 - Leiden-style (LAMDA-database) atomic/molecular data files. These files
   are usable for both LTE and non-LTE radiative transfer calculations.
   They contain information about energy levels, lines and (optionally)
   collisions. The collisional data is optional, but if they are not
   there, then no non-LTE transfer can be done (only LTE transfer). 
   The Leiden database is (obviously) of this type. Also the CHIANTI 
   database can be converted into this form. 

 - RADMC-3D-style line list files. These files do not contain any information
   about the level structure of the atom/molecule. Only lines are listed.
   This is useful for LTE transfer. But non-LTE transfer is not possible
   with these files. The HITRAN database is based on line lists, and can
   be transformed into RADMC-3D standard line list form.
