This is in many respects the same as the jena/ setup. The main difference
is that here the Bohren & Huffman code, as modified by Draine, is used:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codes_for_electromagnetic_scattering_by_spheres

That code is not provided here (please get it yourself from the web). Only
the "shell around it" is provided here. What you must do is:

 1) Get the bhmie.f code (see above link) and put it in this directory.
 2) Type "make", which should compile bhmie.f and make_ca_cs_g.f90
    and produce a code called "makeopac"
 3) Get an .lnk file from the Jena database, e.g.
     http://www.astro.uni-jena.de/Laboratory/OCDB/data/silicate/amorph/pyrmg70.lnk
 4) Edit param.inp to put the name "pyrmg70" on the first line (if you use
    indeed pyrmg70.lnk). The second line should be the grain size in cm.
    The third line the material density in gram/cm^3. And the fourth line
    must, for now, be "1".
 5) Now type ./makeopac and this should produce a file dustkappa_pyrmg70.inp.
    This will have four columns: wavelength in micron, kappa_abs in cm^2/gram,
    kappa_sca in cm^2/gram and the "g" anisotropy factor. 

In python you can plot the opacity file using e.g.:

  import numpy as np
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  data=np.loadtxt('dustkappa_pyrmg70.inp',skiprows=2)
  plt.plot(data[:,0],data[:,1])
  plt.plot(data[:,0],data[:,2],linestyle='--')
  plt.xscale('log')
  plt.yscale('log')
  plt.xlabel("$\lambda\; [\mu\mathrm{m}]$")
  plt.ylabel("$\kappa\; [\mathrm{cm}^2/\mathrm{g}]$")
