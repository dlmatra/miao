Here the BHMIE code of Bohren & Huffman is used to compute the full
scattering matrix table. Instead of writing the dustkappa_xxx.inp file
it will write the dustkapscatmat_xxx.inp file, which contains in addition
to kappa_abs and kappa_scat also the scattering matrix elements 
Z_11, Z_12, Z_22, Z_33, Z_34 and Z_44 from Mie theory. 

For the rest it is very similar to the bohrenhuffman_scatmat/ directory.
The Bohren & Huffman code, as modified by Draine, is used:

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codes_for_electromagnetic_scattering_by_spheres

That code is not provided here (please get it yourself from the web). Only
the "shell around it" is provided here. What you must do is:

 1) Get the bhmie.f code (see above link) and put it in this directory.
 2) Type "make", which should compile bhmie.f and make_scatmat.f90
    and produce a code called "makeopac". It also compiles the code
    make_scatmat_distr.f90 and produces "makeopac_distr". The latter
    does the same as the former, but for a distribution of grain sizes.
    This can be important in order to wash out all too extreme phase
    function fluctuations (see below). 
 3) Get an .lnk file from the Jena database, e.g.
     http://www.astro.uni-jena.de/Laboratory/OCDB/data/silicate/pyrmg70.lnk
 4) Edit param.inp to put the name "pyrmg70" on the first line (if you use
    indeed pyrmg70.lnk). The second line should be the grain size in cm.
    The third line the material density in gram/cm^3 (note: you can find
    this either on the jena website or you'll have to look for this on other
    databases). The fourth line is the number of angle sampling points for
    the phase function (uniformly distributed in angle in degrees between 0
    and 180); a reasonable value for this could be 181, meaning one sampling
    per degree. Finally (optionally) you can give the maximum allowed error
    in the integration of the scattering matrix over angle: The code will
    automatically integrate the Z_11 matrix element over 4*pi and checks if
    this is equal to the kappa_scat that BHMIE gives independently; if it
    exceeds the error tolerance given here, it will stop. The default error
    tolerance is 0.01.
 5) Now type ./makeopac and this produces a file dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70.inp.
    See RADMC-3D manual for the format of this file, although it is realtively
    straightforward.

or if you want to use makeopac_distr:

 4) Edit param_distr.inp. It has almost the same structure as param.inp
    (see above), but there are a few lines added to it to allow you to
    specify the distribution of particles. The second line should be the nr
    of grain sizes you wish to use for the computation of the distribution.
    The more the better, but in the end just a single averaged opacity comes
    out anyway (so, a large number here does not affect the speed of
    RADMC-3D in any way). Then follows the minimal and maximal grain sizes
    in cm (each on a separate line). Then (the fifth line) gives the
    powerlaw index for the distribution function (-3.5 is the usuall MRN
    distribution). From here on the file is again the same as param.inp,
    i.e. the 6th and 7th line contain the material density in gram/cm^3
    and the number of angle sampling points for the phase function. And
    on the 8th line (optionally) you can give the maximum allowed error in
    the integration of the scattering matrix over angle.
 5) Now type ./makeopac_distr and this produces dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70.inp.
    This is a file that can be used as if it is the opacity of a single
    grain, but it is now an average over the grain size distribution.

So a small note about the need for the grain size distribution: If you look
at the scattering phase function for very small wavelengths compared to the
grain size, then you will see that Mie theory produces very strong
oscillations of Z_11 as a function of scattering angle. This is only
realistic if you are convinced that the grain size distribution is extremely
narrow (i.e. nearly perfectly single-size, sometimes called "monodisperse").
In most circumstances you will have a grain size distribution with some
non-negligible width even if still rather narrow. Since the location of the
oscillation peaks depend critically on the grain size, the average
scattering from this distribution would smear out these peaks to a large
extent. In other words: under realistic conditions these extreme peaks will
be smoothed out. In RADMC-3D you can treat grain size distributions, which
would in principle do this averaging automatically for you. But to get a 
good smooth averaging you would have to use a rather fine sampling of the
grain size distribution, which makes RADMC-3D slow and the output files
large. A better way, which we recommend here, is to make the grain size 
distribution in RADMC-3D as coarse as you can afford (i.e.\ "too
coarse" for RADMC-3D would for instance mean if the different grain 
sizes would be spatially separated substantially due to e.g. settling
in a disk, and/or if the expected grain size temperatures are going to be
too large), but compute for each grain size bin of RADMC-3D an entire
finely-sampled grain size distribution in the makeopac_distr code. Then
each RADMC-3D size bin actually represents the average opacity over the
entire grain size range the bin represents. Example: We may want to
sample the grain size in RADMC-3D with 10 bins, logarithmically spaced
between 1 micron and 1000 micron, meaning two neighboring bins are
roughly a factor exp(ln(1000.)/10)=1.99526=~2.0 apart in size. This coarse
spacing is sufficiently fine to avoid too strong temperature differences
and fine enough to allow large grains to settle more closely toward the
midplane of a protoplanetary disk. But for the phase function of scattering
this sampling is way too course, in particular for the larger grain bins.
So what we do is to compute the opacity files dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70_1.inp, 
dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70_2.inp, .... , dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70_10.inp, i.e.
one file for each grain size (and thus we will need 10 grain size 
dust density distributions in the model setup), and for each of these
10 grain sizes we use makeopac_distr using, say, 20 size sampling points.
For RADMC-3D bin 1 the param_distr.inp would then look like e.g.:

pyrmg70
20
0.7071d-4
1.4121d-4
-3.5
3.d0
181
0.1

The 07071d-4 equals 1/sqrt(2.0) and 1.4121 equals sqrt(2.0). 
After calling makeopac_distr we type

   mv dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70.inp dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70_1.inp 

For bin 2 we would have for param_distr.inp

pyrmg70
20
1.4121d-4
2.8284d-4
-3.5
3.d0
181
0.1

etc. Of course it is useful to do this in a script rather than by hand.

If you assume that all dust temperatures are always the same (they are
thermally coupled) or if you are not interested in dust temperatures and
only in the scattering, and if the distribution of dust is the same for
all grain sizes, you do not need separate RADMC-3D bins. You could then
make the entire distribution in one go. For instance:

pyrmg70
20
1d-4
1d0
-3.5
3.d0
181
0.1

which makes an MRN grain size distribution from 1 micron all the way
to 1 cm grain size and put everything into a single file
dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70.inp. This is of course the easiest in terms of
RADMC-3D modeling, because then you need to only make a model for
"the" dust, and not worry about the size distribution.
