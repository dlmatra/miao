DUST OPACITIES FROM OSSENKOPF & HENNING 1994
--------------------------------------------

The opacity table database for dust opacities from the Ossenkopf & Henning
1994 paper is located at:

http://hera.ph1.uni-koeln.de/~ossk/Jena/tables.html

These tables contain two columns. The first gives the wavelength in micron.
The second the absorption opacity in cm^2/gram-of-refractory-dust. Note:
This is NOT per gram of dust, but per gram of refractory dust (i.e. per 
gram of non-icy dust material). This is also the way in which the IDL
program below will convert it into dustkappa_osshenn.inp. 

The simple IDL code to convert from the tables from Ossenkopf to the
RADMC-3D standard format is:

  make_opac.pro

Just do the following:

 - First download one of the opacity files of Ossenkopf & Henning from
   the above web site. In the example here you should download:

      http://hera.ph1.uni-koeln.de/~ossk/Jena/tables/thin5

 - Then go into IDL and type:

      .r make_opac

 - This should convert into dustkappa_osshenn.inp

 - It will immediately thereafter read in this opacity in the standard
   RADMC-3D way, and plot it on the screen.

NOTE: The opacity tables of Ossenkopf & Henning only go down to 1 micron
      wavelength! Therefore we have to extrapolate to shorter wavelength,
      because RADMC-3D needs to have the opacity also in the wavelength
      domain where the stars emit light. This is done in a very ad-hoc
      way, but I see no other way.

NOTE: Icy grains have a ice feature in the NIR. Be careful with this! If you
      see this feature in emission in your RADMC-3D model spectra, then you
      apparently heated up the dust to temperatures where the ice should, in
      reality, have long evaporated. Since RADMC-3D does not explicitly
      treat evaporation, this would give physically wrong results. The ice
      feature should NEVER be in emission! This feature can only be seen in
      absorption. The best way to deal with this is to first do a
      calculation with RADMC-3D with this icy dust, and then replace it with
      ice-free dust in all regions where the temperature turns out to be
      above, say, 100 K or so. Though please look at the phase diagram of
      water to find out at which pressures and temperatures ice can remain
      in solid form. See e.g. Bauer, I., Finocchi, F., Duschl, W. J., 
      Gail, H.-P., & Schloder, J. P. 1997, A&A, 317, 273.
