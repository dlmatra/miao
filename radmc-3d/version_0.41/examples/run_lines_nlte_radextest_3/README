Here I do a trivial test of the escape probability subroutine (which is
also the LVG subroutine, by the way, but now with the escape probability
merely calculated from the geometry, not the velocity gradient). 

I test against the RADEX code of Floris van der Tak:

   http://www.sron.rug.nl/~vdtak/radex/radex.php

which is described in the following paper:

   Van der Tak, F.F.S., Black, J.H., Sch√∂ier, F.L., Jansen, D.J., van
   Dishoeck, E.F., 2007, A&A 468, 627-635.

The setup here has a CO column density 1000x higher than the 
default setup of RADEX. The setup here is:

   T_bg  = 2.73 K
   T_gas = 30.  K
   n_H2  = 1d4  cm^(-3)
   N_CO  = 1d17 cm^(-2)    (compared to the default 1d14)
   dv    = 1    km/s

The resulting excitation temperatures RADEX returns are:

   T_ex [J1-0] = 29.0 K    tau0 = 2.6
   T_ex [J2-1] = 27.5 K    tau0 = 8.1
   T_ex [J3-2] = 26.3 K    tau0 = 11.4
   T_ex [J4-3] = 23.3 K    tau0 = 10.6

The excitation temperatures that RADMC-3D returns are:

   T_ex [J1-0] = 28.9 K
   T_ex [J2-1] = 27.2 K
   T_ex [J3-2] = 25.8 K
   T_ex [J4-3] = 22.6 K

Given that perhaps the setups are not 100% the same, I think this 
agreement is satisfactory. 

The way to run the model:

  idl
  .r problem_setup
  exit
  radmc3d calcpop
  idl
  .r readradmc
  a=read_levelpop('co',/ext)
  print,a.ext[0:3]

which gives the above numbers.
