This is a simple 2-D envelope model with some density dependence of the
theta-coordinate.

NOTE: Dust scattering is switched off in this model. But this can easily
      be switched back on (see scattering_mode_max in problem_setup.py).

This directory should contain the following files: 

  README                         (This file)
  Makefile                       (Only for convenient cleanmodel and cleanall)
  dustkappa_silicate.inp         (some dust opacity file)
  problem_setup.py               (a python script for setting up some input files)
  plot_session.py                (an example run with some plots)

This is what the model does:

  It puts a spherical envelope of dust around a star and computes the
  temperature structure of the envelope. You can then make spectra and
  images.

This is what you should do to run this model:

  1) Make sure you have compiled the main radmc3d code in src/ already.
     See manual for how to compile.
  2) Type python problem_setup.py in the linux/unix shell. This should
     set up your model. You need, of course, a working installation of
     python 2.7 on your system.
  3) In the shell type:

      radmc3d mctherm
      radmc3d sed
      radmc3d image lambda 10

     The first command will compute the self-consistent dust temperature.
     The second command will compute the spectral energy distribution (spectrum).
     The third command will make an image at 10 micron.
  4) Now you can make plots. See plot_session.py for examples how 
     to run RADMC-3D and make various plots and images and spectra.
  5) Note that plot_session.py in fact automatically calls RADMC-3D,
     reads the results and makes the plots (but please keep in mind
     that plot_session.py is just meant as examples). Type 

     ipython --matplotlib

     to go into python. Then type:

     %run plot_session

     This should automatically run the code and produce various plots
     that should pop up.

Note: plot_session.py also demonstrates the use of circular images.
