This is a simple 3-D rotating ring model of molecular gas.
The lines we study are those of CO. We use the LTE assumption, using
lines_mode=1. The populations are stored for all levels (no level
subset is chosen). The molecular data file molecule_co.inp is a direct
copy of the co.dat file of the LAMDA database from Leiden. 

Check out the problem_setup.pro. The dust temperature is not calculated; it
is simply set to 300 K, as is the gas temperature. 

As usual, make the setup in IDL with:

 .r problem_setup

Now you can see the image with:

 .r viewimage
 viewimage,/lines

By default the wavelength of the image you see is not exactly on the line.
Therefore initially you only see the ring of the dust emission.
But if you enter the v [km/s] value and press return, you should suddenly
see two blobs on top of the ring, which are the line emission at that
velocity channel.
