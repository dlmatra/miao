This is a model similar to run_simple_1, but now with multiple blobs, and
the star not being inside a blob. 

  ipython problem_setup.py
  radmc3d mctherm
  ipython
    from problem_plotexamples import *

Note that in the plotting example the wavelength is now set to 10 microns.
You see in the image that only one side of each blob emits substantial
amounts of light: the side toward the star. This is the effect of
illumination of the blobs by the star. Be careful, though, that the
spatial resolution is very low.
