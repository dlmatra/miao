This is a very simple 1-D model of a molecular gas with a velocity
gradient. The populations of CO are computed using the LVG method
(lines_mode==3). The model must be at least 1-D because otherwise no velocity
gradient can be calculated. In fact, when trying to use LVG for a 0-D model
the code will stop.

The populations are stored for all levels (no level subset is chosen). The
molecular data file molecule_co.inp is a direct copy of the co.dat file of
the LAMDA database from Leiden.

Check out the problem_setup.pro. The setup can be trivially extended to
3-D. The dust temperature is not calculated; it is simply set to 30 K.

By typing:

  radmc3d calcpop

a file levelpop_co.dat is produced, containing the absolute populations
(i.e. in units of 1/cm^3) of all levels of the molecule_co.inp file. By
typing

  radmc3d spectrum iline 1 widthkms 1

a spectrum is produced (spectrum.out). The width of the window around the
line center is taken to be 1 km/s. You can inspect the spectrum (which is
located in the file spectrum.out) using the IDL routines readradmc.pro. So
go into IDL and type:

  .r readradmc
  s=readspectrum()
  plotspectrum,s,/xlin,/ylin,dpc=140.

which plots the spectrum as seen from a distance of 140 parsec. The
/xlin and /ylin are to force the plotspectrum routine to use linear
x and y axes. The reason is that plotspectrum was originally written
for SEDs. Also note that the x-axis is in actual wavelengths in microns.
To convert to velocities you will have to do some hand-work, plotting
the data in your own way. The structure s contains the spectrum as seen
at 1 parsec distance in units of erg/cm^2/s/Hz (which is also the unit
of the spectrum values in the spectrum.out file).
