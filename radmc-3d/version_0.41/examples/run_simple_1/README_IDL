This is perhaps the most primitive example of a model setup for radmc3d.
It follows the general philosophy of creating all the input files for
radmc3d via an IDL script called problem_setup.pro. The model calculation
is then done by the globally (for the user) installed radmc3d, i.e. the
radmc3d from the src/ directory.

This directory should contain the following files: 

  README_IDL                     (This file)
  Makefile                       (Only for convenient cleanmodel and cleanall)
  dustkappa_silicate.inp         (some dust opacity file)
  problem_setup.pro              (an IDL script for setting up some input files)

This is what the model does:

  The model sets up a simple Gaussian blob of dust surrounding a star in a
  3-D cartesian grid. It is the same model as the one in run_simple_userdef_1/
  but this time it is set up in the classical way: using an external
  script to create all input files.

This is what you should do to run this model:

  1) Make sure you have compiled the main radmc3d code in src/ already.
     See manual for how to compile.
  2) Go into IDL and type '.r problem_setup.pro'
  3) Exit IDL
  4) In the shell type 'radmc3d mctherm' and wait until this is finished
     NOTE: Do not, as in run_simple_userdef_1/, type './radmc3d mctherm' (i.e.
     do not use the ./).
  6) Go back into IDL
  7) Inside IDL type '.r viewimage.pro' (if you have followed the advice on
     how to install the IDL subroutines, this should work just like that).
  8) Inside IDL type 'viewimage'. This should spawn the image viewer. 

Apart from viewing images, you can also make a spectrum. To make an SED
on the same wavelength grid as in wavelength_micron.inp, and at a viewing
angle given by an inclination of say 25 degrees and a phi-angle of say 85
degrees, do the following (after having gone through the above stuff):

  1) Type in the shell: 
     radmc3d sed incl 25. phi 85.
  2) Go into IDL
  3) .r readradmc
  4) s=readspectrum()
  5) plotspectrum,s,dpc=140.

This will plot the spectrum in nu*F_nu as seen from a distance of 140
parsec.  You can also plot it in Jy: plotspectrum,s,dpc=140.,/jy, or as
nu*F_nu in units of solar luminosity: plotspectrum,s,/lsun. 

You can also make a spectrum of a small part of the spectral range:

  1) Type in the shell: 
     radmc3d spectrum incl 25. phi 85. lambdarange 5. 20. nlam 100
  2) Go into IDL
  3) .r readradmc
  4) s=readspectrum()
  5) plotspectrum,s,dpc=140.

The spectrum itself is written out in a file called spectrum.out. Just type
less spectrum.out to see the file. The flux is in CGS units, and normalized
to 1 parsec distance (although for all purposes the true flux will be at
much larger distances, but you can simply scale the spectrum by the factor
(parsec/distance)^2, because for the spectrum the far-field limit is used,
in spite of the "1 parsec" normalization.

Please have a close look at the problem_setup.pro file for getting an 
understanding of how this model is set up. 

NOTE: Scattering is switched off in this example run. The 
      opacity file dustkappa_silicate.inp does include the
      scattering opacity (third column). This would allow
      a treatment of isotropic scattering. To switch on the
      isotropic scattering, put scattering_mode_max = 1 in
      radmc3d.inp (or better: see problem_setup.pro where 
      this file is created).

In the compute_radfield.pro file you can see an example of how to use
RADMC-3D to compute the mean intensity J_nu of the radiation field at
every point in the model. It produces a list of wavelengths in the file

  mcmono_wavelength_micron.inp

and then calls RADMC-3D in the following way:

  radmc3d mcmono nphot_mono 1000000

This then produces the file 

  mean_intensity.out

which contains the mean intensities. The mean intensities are in units
of erg/s/cm^2/Hz/ster. 

29.07.09, 22.09.09, 13.03.12, 20.05.12

NOTE: As of version 0.31 of RADMC-3D this model comes with a dust opacity
      table that spans a larger wavelength range, allowing it to be used
      down to lower temperatures. The new opacity table is made with the Mie
      code from the opac/dust_continuum/jena/ directory, using the
      olmg50.lnk optical constants file from the Jena database. This is
      MgFeSiO4 with a specific weight of 3.71 gram/cm^3. The grain size is
      0.1 micron radius.
