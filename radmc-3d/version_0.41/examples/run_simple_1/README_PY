This is perhaps the most primitive example of a model setup for radmc3d.
It follows the general philosophy of creating all the input files for
radmc3d via a python script called problem_setup.py. The model calculation
is then done by the globally (for the user) installed radmc3d, i.e. the
radmc3d from the src/ directory.

This directory should contain the following files: 

  README_PY                      (This file)
  Makefile                       (Only for convenient cleanmodel and cleanall)
  dustkappa_silicate.inp         (some dust opacity file)
  problem_setup.py               (a python script for setting up some input files)

This is what the model does:

  The model sets up a simple Gaussian blob of dust surrounding a star in a
  3-D cartesian grid. It is the same model as the one in run_simple_userdef_1/
  but this time it is set up in the classical way: using an external
  script to create all input files.

This is what you should do to run this model:

  1) Make sure you have compiled the main radmc3d code in src/ already.
     See manual for how to compile.
  2) Type python problem_setup.py
  3) In the shell type 'radmc3d mctherm' and wait until this is finished
     NOTE: Do not, as in run_simple_userdef_1/, type './radmc3d mctherm' (i.e.
     do not use the ./). NOTE: If you compiled the code with openmp,
     then you can speed up the code with e.g. 'radmc3d mctherm setthreads 4'.
  4) Make sure that the radmc3dPy subroutines are found by python, e.g.
     by setting the shell environment variable PYTHONPATH to the 
     python directory in your ~/bin/ directory. 
     Example on a Mac: if you use tcsh:
       setenv PYTHONPATH '/Users/cornelisdullemond/bin/python/'
     If you use bash:
       export PYTHONPATH=/Users/cornelisdullemond/bin/python/
     where of course "cornelisdullemond" should be instead your
     own username, and on Linux systems perhaps also the /Users/
     is different.
  5) Go into python with matplotlib interactive mode:
        ipython --matplotlib
  6) Now you can use the problem_plotexamples.py to make an image and
     create some plots. Please read the problem_plotexamples.py script
     to learn how to do these things interactively. You can run this
     script from the python prompt with:
        from problem_plotexamples import *

One of the examples in the problem_plotexamples.py is how to make a
spectral energy distribution. Go into ipython --matplotlib and type

  from problem_plotexamples import *

You can also compute a spectrum straight from the shell by:

   radmc3d sed incl 60 phi 30

where incl and phi are the viewing angles. The SED is is written out in a
file called spectrum.out. Just type less spectrum.out to see the file. The
flux is in CGS units, and normalized to 1 parsec distance (although for all
purposes the true flux will be at much larger distances, but you can simply
scale the spectrum by the factor (parsec/distance)^2, because for the
spectrum the far-field limit is used, in spite of the "1 parsec"
normalization.

Note also that radmc3dPy has routines for reading the spectrum and
for plotting it (after you ran radmc3d sed incl 60 phi 30 on the shell).
Just type in ipython --matplotlib the following:

  from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
  from radmc3dPy.analyze import *
  s=readSpectrum()
  plotSpectrum(s,xlg=True,ylg=True,micron=True)
  plt.axis([1e-1,1e4,1e-12,1e-4])

To learn all the options of plotSpectrum() just type

  ?plotSpectrum

Please have a close look at the problem_setup.py file for getting an 
understanding of how this model is set up. 

NOTE: Scattering is switched off in this example run. The 
      opacity file dustkappa_silicate.inp does include the
      scattering opacity (third column). This would allow
      a treatment of isotropic scattering. To switch on the
      isotropic scattering, put scattering_mode_max = 1 in
      radmc3d.inp (or better: see problem_setup.py where 
      this file is created).

RADMC-3D can also be used to compute the mean intensity J_nu of the
radiation field at every point in the model. It produces a list of
wavelengths in the file

  mcmono_wavelength_micron.inp

and then calls RADMC-3D in the following way:

  radmc3d mcmono nphot_mono 1000000

This then produces the file 

  mean_intensity.out

which contains the mean intensities. The mean intensities are in units
of erg/s/cm^2/Hz/ster.
