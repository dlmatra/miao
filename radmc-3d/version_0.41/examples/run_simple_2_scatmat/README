This is almost identical to run_simple_1, but with a lower density and a
different opacity, AND: with a full scattering matrix opacity file, so that
scattering is now done in full Stokes mode (for spherical or randomly
oriented particles). 

The dust opacity file dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70.inp was created in the
opac/bohrenhuffman_scatmat/ directory, using the pyrmg70.lnk optical
constants file from the Jena database. 

See the README file of run_simple_1 to run this model. See, however,
the manual of RADMC-3D (and the README file of the bohrenhuffman_scatmat
directory) to learn more about the anisotropic scattering. 

*** NOTE: Currently the anisotropic full-polarized scattering mode is still
in the testing phase (04.02.2013). So please be careful, and report any
errors you may find.  ***
