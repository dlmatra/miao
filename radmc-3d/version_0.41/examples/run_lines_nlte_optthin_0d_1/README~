This is a very simple 0-D (one-zone) model of a box of ionized gas,
radiating in [OIII] forbidden lines. The model in fact chooses the 5007
Angrstroem line in particular (simply skipping the other ones; by using the
level subset method, see manual). Note that the line is in fact at 5008
Angstroem. The 5007 Angstroem wavelength that is classically cited in the
literature is what it looks like when observed in the Earth's atmosphere.
The 5008 Angstroem is the vacuum wavelength.

The atomic data file molecule_o+2.inp is produced from the CHIANTI database.

Check out the problem_setup.pro. The setup can be trivially extended to
3-D. The dust temperature is not calculated, and is in fact irrelevant for
the model. 

The lines_mode=4, meaning that collisionally excited level populations are
computed under the optically thin assumption. The populations are stored only
for the levels 3 and 4 (see lines.inp). By typing:

  radmc3d calcpop

a file levelpop_o+2.dat is produced, containing the absolute populations
(i.e. in units of 1/cm^3) of these levels (levels 3 and 4). By typing

  radmc3d spectrum iline 7 widthkms 10

a spectrum is produced around the 5007 Angstroem line (line 7 from the
line list in molecule_o+2.inp). The width of the window around the line
center is taken to be 10 km/s. You can inspect the spectrum (which is
located in the file spectrum.out) using the IDL routines readradmc.pro.
So go into IDL and type:

  .r readradmc
  s=readspectrum()
  plotspectrum,s,/xlin,/ylin,dpc=140.

which plots the spectrum as seen from a distance of 140 parsec. The
/xlin and /ylin are to force the plotspectrum routine to use linear
x and y axes. The reason is that plotspectrum was originally written
for SEDs. Also note that the x-axis is in actual wavelengths in microns.
To convert to velocities you will have to do some hand-work, plotting
the data in your own way. The structure s contains the spectrum as seen
at 1 parsec distance in units of erg/cm^2/s/Hz (which is also the unit
of the spectrum values in the spectrum.out file).

Note that if you try to make a spectrum around another line, nothing will
show up, because only levels 3 and 4 are stored, so only for the 5007 Ang
line the levels are known. If you would modify lines.inp (or better: modify
problem_setup.pro) so that all levels are stored, then all lines can be seen
in the spectrum, some of which might, however, be very weak.

You can, of course, also make images, but you will just see a single block:
the 1-cell model.
