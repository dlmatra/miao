As run_lines_lte_3d_1, but now with:

 - Computing the dust temperature self-consistently, and

 - Taking the gas temperature to be equal to the dust temperature
   using the tgas_eq_tdust   = 1 option in the radmc3d.inp file.

So, first compile RADMC-3D of course. Then go into this directory and
in IDL type

  .r problem_setup

Then in the linux shell do:

  radmc3d mctherm

After that you can basically do all the stuff that is described in the
file ../run_lines_lte_3d_1/README.
