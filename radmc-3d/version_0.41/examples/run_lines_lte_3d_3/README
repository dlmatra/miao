Now let us test what happens if the local line width is too small compared
to the velocity gradient over each cell. We take a problem with a linear
gradient in y-direction of v_y and a very narrow intrinsic line width
compared to the overall velocity gradient. You will find that you get
good images if you use the doppler catching mode, but it will go entirely
wrong without it (sometimes the line emission does not even appear at
all without doppler catching).

So, first compile RADMC-3D of course. Then go into this directory and
in IDL type

  .r problem_setup

and for interactive images:

  .r viewimage
  viewimage,/lines

Now go e.g. in the iline field and type "return". You would now expect
to see something of line emission. However, you will see nothing apart
from the normal dust emission. This is exactly because of this doppler
jumping problem. 

However, if you now click the "dcatch" button, you will suddenly see
a 2-D emission plane appearing.
