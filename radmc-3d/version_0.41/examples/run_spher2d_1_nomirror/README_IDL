As run_spher2d_1/ but now without the midplane mirroring trick. In
run_spher2d_1/ only the upper half of the model was included, and RADMC-3D
automatically assumes then that the lower half is the mirror copy of the
upper half. Here, however, the full upper and lower half are explicitly
included. This is necessary, for instance, when using polarized scattering,
since that does not allow mirroring.
