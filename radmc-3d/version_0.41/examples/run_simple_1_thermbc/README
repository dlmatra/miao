This is a test of the "thermal wall" boundary condition that you can
impose in cartesian coordinates. The model is identical to the one of
run_simple_1/ (see run_simple_1/README for more details on how to
run the model), except that:

 - There is no star in the model
 - The density is 100x larger 
 - All 6 edges of the domain are now thermal walls at 100 Kelvin

The way we tell RADMC-3D to impose these thermal walls is by setting

   thermal_boundary_xl = 100.

in the radmc3d.inp file (for the left-x-boundary); other extensions 
can be _xr, _yl, _yr, _zl, _zr, standing for the l/r boundary in
x/y/z direction. The radmc3d.inp file is created in the IDL program
problem_setup.pro (as are most of other input files), and in this 
example all 6 boundaries are taken to be thermal walls at 100 Kelvin.
The theory of thermodynamics says that then the temperature of the
dust must also become 100 K, irrespective of the shape of the opacity.
As you can see when you run the example with

  radmc3d mctherm

and load the resulting temperature into IDL and plot a cut:

  .r readradmc
  a=read_data(/dtemp)
  surface,a.temp[*,*,16]

the temperature is indeed (modulo noise) 100 K. 

Now you can experiment with having only one or two thermal walls,
by removing some of the thermal_boundary_XX = 100. lines. You can
then see how the temperature is close to 100 near the wall, but
decays toward larger distances from the wall.

NOTE: As of version 0.31 of RADMC-3D this model comes with a dust opacity
      table that spans a larger wavelength range, allowing it to be used
      down to lower temperatures. The new opacity table is made with the Mie
      code from the opac/dust_continuum/jena/ directory, using the
      olmg50.lnk optical constants file from the Jena database. This is
      MgFeSiO4 with a specific weight of 3.71 gram/cm^3. The grain size is
      0.1 micron radius.
