This is a model of a protoplanetary disk. It has a graphical user interface
for the setup:

   radmc3d_gui.pro

This is what you should do to run this model:

  1) Make sure you have compiled the main radmc3d code in src/ already.
     See manual for how to compile.
  2) Go into IDL and type:
      .r radmc3d
      radmc3d
      and you should get a large control panel. 
  3) The rest should be self-explanatory.
