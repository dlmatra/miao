Similar setup as run_simple_1. But now we demonstrate the polarized thermal
emission from aligned grains. This setup only exists in python (not IDL).

IMPORTANT NOTICE: The alignment asymmetry of the dust opacities (as given in
   dustkapscatmat_pyrmg70.inp) are PURELY FICTIONAL in this example. To do
   it right, you would have to use e.g. a T-matrix code to compute the
   absorption opacity of an oblate grain as seen from the various angles. 

The alignment direction vector field is assumed to be toroidal (rotating
around the z-axis). Since the grains are assumed to be oblate, with their
minor axis along the alignment direction (see the fictional alignment
asymmetry mentioned above), the polarization direction (the E-field) is
(for face-on view, i.e. theta=0) perpendicular to the alignment direction.
For theta larger than about 45 degrees the polarization direction mostly
points vertical. 

Partial alignment is included in this example: the alignment fraction is
0 near the midplane (z=0) and increases quadratically with z to 1 between
z=0 and z=radius. For z>radius the alignment is assumed to be perfect.

To run this example:

   python problem_setup.py
   radmc3d mctherm
   radmc3d image lambda 0.4e3 theta 45 phi 45 nostar

   ipython --matplotlib
   %run problem_plot

You can plot the individual Stokes components and the polarized intensity
by continuing in python:

   from radmc3dPy import image
   plotImage(a,cmap=cm.hot,au=True,bunit='inu',stokes='Q')

or

   plotImage(a,cmap=cm.hot,au=True,bunit='inu',stokes='U')

or

   plotImage(a,cmap=cm.hot,au=True,bunit='inu',stokes='PI')
