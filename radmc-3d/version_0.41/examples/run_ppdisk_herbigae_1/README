This is the Herbig Ae disk model that used to be named run_example_ppdisk/
in the DISK2D Release 3.1 distribution. I ported it to RADMC-3D. Note that
this is a fixed pre-given density structure, so no self-consistent
hydrostatic structure iteration is done. Note also that this involves two
dust species, one crystalline and one amorphous. 

IMPORTANT: This model is a relatively complex setup. Please use with care. 
So far I did not have the time to make a sufficiently detailed "manual" for
this model. 



Important note about sub-pixeling:

This model has a rather extreme refinement of the radial coordinate near the
inner edge. As a result, when you make an image or an SED, RADMC-3D uses
sub-pixeling to an extreme degree. This is because it does not want to run
the risk of accidently overlooking cells that are with their short dimension
perpentidular to the line of sight. For most cases this extreme degree of
sub-pixeling is, in practice, not necessary. It is necessary only for really
extremely optically thick disk models that are seen nearly face-on. So if
you feel confortable that in your case it is not such a pathological case
(the best way to find out is to test this) you can limit the sub-pixeling
by adding a line

camera_min_drr = 0.03

in the radmc3d.inp file. This makes it faster by suppressing the
sub-pixeling a bit (cells with Delta R/R < camera_min_drr will not induce
further sub-pixeling). You can make it even faster with

camera_min_drr = 0.3

but this could, for the near-infrared flux (from the inner rim) be a bit
dangerous.
