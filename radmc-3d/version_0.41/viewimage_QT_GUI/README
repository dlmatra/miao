This directory contains the new viewimage GUI version that is no longer
dependent on IDL. Viewimage (originally viewimage.pro) is meant to help
you make and view images with RADMC-3D in an interactive manner. It is not
required for modeling with RADMC-3D, but it does make life easier when 
you wish to investigate your model.

It requires the installation of Qt (pronounced as "cute") which is (in
contrast to IDL) open source! See the website of the Qt project:

http://qt-project.org

Many thanks to Farzin Sereshti (sereshti@uni-heidelberg.de) for developing
this cute widget!
