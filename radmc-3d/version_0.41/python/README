INSTALLATION
------------

1) Standard global python install with distutils (sudo/root privileges are needed)

    $>python setup.py install

This will install radmc3dPy to the standard python directory (/usr/..../site-packages or
    /opt/..../site-packages for a standard python installation in most unix/linux systems)

2) Standard local python install with distutils (without root privileges)
    
    $>python setup.py install --user

    This will install radmc3dPy to $HOME/.local/lib/python3.X/site-packages or 
    $HOME/.local/lib/python2.X/site-packages depending on the python version used.

    Alternatively it is also possible to install radmc3dPy to an arbitrary directory by using the --prefix option:
    
    $>python setup.py install --prefix=DIR

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

radmc3dPy relies on several auxiliary but widely used python packages:

    matplotlib      - used for visualization/plotting
    numpy           - used for array operations
    astropy.io.fits - previously known as PyFits, ython library for fits file handling
